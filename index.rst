===================
The Ports Framework
===================

.. NOTE::
   This documentation relates to Ports version |version|.


**Ports is a Java framework for inter-component communication within a JVM process.**

Core features:

* Very effective decoupling of components.
* Acts like a high-performance, *type-safe* enterprise service bus.
* Strong support for asynchronicity and parallelism.
* Declarative description of tests (in the manner of mocking frameworks).
* Fault injection.
* AOP-like features for monitoring, logging, or debugging.
* Built-in support for union types (``Either`` and ``Either3``),
  making error handling easier.
